Ok, this project right now have only links to databases. 
And when you click on any of them it will be opened in 
SQLiteAdministrator (if you set as default handler for *.s3db files)

But to have it inside VS is already a handy stuff. 

In future this project whould open this files in VS2010
as system.data.sqlite.org project will done with their new version.

In a distant paradise futuew we will have linq t4 templates to autogenerate 
code for db.
